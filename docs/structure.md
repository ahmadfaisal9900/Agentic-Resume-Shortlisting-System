# Project Structure

## Directory Overview

- **`src/`** - Main source code and library modules
- **`data/`** - Shared data files (do not commit private/sensitive data)
- **`scripts/`** - Runnable scripts and entry points not meant to be included in the library
- **`notebooks/`** - Jupyter and Marimo notebooks for experimentation and analysis
- **`docs/`** - Project documentation

## Misc

- **pyproject.toml** - Project configuration file - `requirements.txt` is not the recommended way anymore
