# HR RAG System (Research Prototype)

Current only active file -> research/HR_RAG_System.ipynb

This repository contains an experimental implementation of an **Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipeline designed for candidateâ€“job matching and ranking.
It integrates **LangGraph**, **DSPy**, **LanceDB**, and **Google Generative AI (Gemini)** for building an intelligent retrieval and reasoning system.

## Current Structure

At this stage, all experiments and architecture exploration are conducted in a single Jupyter notebook:

The project is currently in the **research and prototyping** phase.
Once the architecture, retrieval strategy, and evaluation metrics are finalized, the system will be refactored into a structured, production-ready project directory with separate modules.
