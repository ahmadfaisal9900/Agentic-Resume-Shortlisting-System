SAS advanced license         Thesis/Dissertation     Projects:  A.  Time: from 2014 January to 2014 Match   Title: the relationship between the mathematical grade of the seventh grade and grades from primary school.  Brief process: use linear model to fit transformed variables from the data after getting rid of useless columns, choose the most significant variables to form the final model based on persuasive diagnostic values.  Achievements from the project:the mathematical grade of the seventh grade is significantly influenced by the reading, counting and logistic ability at the first and second grade in the primary school.   B.  Time: from 2014 May to 2014 August  Title:bike rental prediction  Brief process: construct the regression model use different statistical method, find the most powerful model decided by finding the least error rate, and decide which variables significantly enough to build the model.  Achievements from the project: use Lasso to make the regression, it gives the least error rate and use the almost original data set, it saves a lot of time to deal with the original data set.  C.  Time:from 2014 September to October  Title: Classify Song Release Period  Brief process: construct the classification model to classify a specific song into the year before or after the year 1986 based on 90 attributes of a single song and 6480 songs.  Achievements from the project: use the Multivariate adaptive regression splines to build the model and based on the final classification model, we can conclude that if the song is from before or after on 1986 depends mostly on the artists who create them, secondly on properties they tagged by famous music website and finally on properties of their track.  D.  Time: from 2014 November to 2014 December  Title: predict the lightening strikes in July based on the records from January to June.  Brief process: first cluster the original data based on the lightening strike records and the moisture records with the method of K-mean and Hierarchical method. Second use different statistical method like Boosting, Random Forest, Ridge, Lasso, NNET, CART, SVM to find the best model to predict the strikes will happen.  Achievements from the project: we use the K-mean clustering method and based on the moisture data to form the cluster and use the neural network is a better way for our prediction to get a smaller MSE, and lightning strike have direct relationship with the soil moisture level and the climate indices.  E.  Time: from 2014 November to 2014 December  Title: predict the daily stock price of Netflix Inc. Based on historical daily price records.  Brief process: use GARCH model to fit the transformed data and finally choose the GARCH plus ARMAR model to make the forecasting.  Achievements from the project: from the model we can find that there is a up trend in the future about this stock and this is a appropriate time to buy this piece of stock.
